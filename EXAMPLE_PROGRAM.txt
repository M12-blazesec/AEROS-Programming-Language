This is an example program in AEROSPL. It is a simple, text-based calculator program.

Note: Just as in BASIC on many older computer systems, you must label lines with their line number, this is so the 'goto'
statement will work properly.

This program takes a first and second integer from the user, and then asks the user for an operator choice. The user makes
an operator choice based on the list given, the calculation is done, with the answer being printed, and the program looping
back to the user entering his or her first integer. This program would loop forever, or untill the hardware is turned off, so
at the end of the program (lines 41 through 43) there is an exit function, so that the user can exit/shutdown the program.
This function sets it up so that if at any time, the user enters an exit command (any that is inside of the list in line 41),
the program will shutdown.
