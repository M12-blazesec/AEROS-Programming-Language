# AEROS-Programming-Language
This is a project to develop a programming language that is a bastardization of C. That's kind of it. It is going to be a programming language based primarily upon the C programming language. The goal of the AEROSPL is to create a low-level programming language that can be easily understood by someone with even rudementary experience with programming. There will eventually be compilers written in C, Python, Batch, and a Web (HTML5, CSS, JS) compiler, so that the programming language can be used on a great plethora of platforms. That is the goal as of the creation of this repository on 4/23/2020 at about 10:45pm PST
